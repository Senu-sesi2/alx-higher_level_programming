# Introduction

* The core function of this project "0x14. JavaScript - Web scraping" is a concept of web scraping using JavaScript technologies. Web scraping involves extracting data from websites, allowing developers to gather, process, and analyze information from the web. This project aims to teach how to use JavaScript, along with libraries and frameworks like Puppeteer or Cheerio, to automate the process of accessing web pages, navigating through content, and extracting specific pieces of information.

## Here are the key objective of this project

1. Learning Basics of Web Scraping:
Understand what web scraping is and why it's useful for extracting information from websites. This includes learning about ethical considerations and compliance with website terms of service when scraping.

2. JavaScript and Node.js:
Get familiar with JavaScript as a server-side language and how to use Node.js to run JavaScript outside of a browser context. This forms the foundation for web scraping tasks.

3. Using Web Scraping Libraries:
Learn to use popular libraries and frameworks designed for web scraping, such as Puppeteer (a headless browser automation library) or Cheerio (a library for parsing and manipulating HTML). These tools are essential for interacting with web pages and extracting data.

4. Automating Browser Interactions:
Explore how to simulate user interactions with websites, such as navigating between pages, clicking buttons, filling out forms, and more. This automation capability is key to scraping complex websites.

5. Data Extraction and Processing:
Understand how to extract specific data from web pages, like text, images, links, tables, or other HTML elements. This often involves learning about CSS selectors, XPath, and other techniques to identify and retrieve data from the page structure.

6. Managing Web Scraping Challenges:
Address common challenges in web scraping, such as handling dynamic content (like AJAX-based websites), avoiding rate limits, and bypassing simple anti-scraping mechanisms (while respecting website terms of service and ethical practices).

7. Storing and Using Scraped Data:
Learn how to store extracted data for further analysis or integration with other systems. This could involve saving to files, databases, or other data structures.

In summary, the core function of this ALX project is to equip learners with the skills and tools necessary for web scraping using JavaScript, providing hands-on experience in building scripts that can automate browser interactions, extract data from websites, and manage common challenges in this domain.
